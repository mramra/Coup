Coup is a bluffing card game where the players are politicians. Corrupt politicians. The objective of the game is to expose the other players as more corrupt than you are.
For this clone, I focused on making unit test for the game mechanics. I know this game very well and I've seen all of the possible interactions in the base game.
To play, type "python console.py" in your console.
